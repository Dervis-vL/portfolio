                For the 'Traffic Bridge Tool,' I led the development of a comprehensive process enabling the modeling of a bridge entirely in Revit and RFEM based on fundamental inputs.
            </p><p>
                The output is a traffic bridge compliant with norms (Eurocode and/or ROK) at the preliminary design (VO) level. 
                A process that normally would take at least a week is now completed and ready to be deilvered in an hour.
            </p><p>
                Output includes traditional deliverables such as a PDF report, appendices with calculations, technical drawings with dimensions, 
                a complete RFEM model with all loads and traffic considerations, and a Revit 3D model of the bridge.
            </p><p>
                I authored the architecture of the tool, outlining the plan of approach and designing the complete data model. In this project, I served as the lead developer.
            </p><p> 
                The tool's workflow involves loading input data into the Python 'Bridge' object, followed by preprocessing within the bridge object. In this project, I served as the lead developer.
            </p><p>
                The data is then sent to third-party software for processing (RFEM and Revit).
            </p><p>
                Within RFEM, an iterative process determines which foundation piles need to be added based on the bridge's coordinates. 
            </p><p>
                Upon completion, results from RFEM model sections are analyzed to conduct assessments and validate the construction model. All data is then archived into appendices and a report.
            </p><p>
                What makes the development process of this tool smart is the development of specific Python packages for each component, applicable not only to the tool but also company-wide for engineers.
            </p><p>
                This approach allows us to generate more value from the scripts. Refer to my other portfolio pages for descriptions of individual packages.
